# Multi-Module Android Application with Advanced Architecture

## Overview

This repository houses a multi-module Android application showcasing advanced architectural patterns, primarily Clean Architecture with MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and use cases. The project is designed to demonstrate best practices in Android development, emphasizing modularity, testability, and scalability.

## What is this repository for?

This repository serves as a comprehensive example of building a production-level Android application using:
- Clean Architecture for separation of concerns and maintainability.
- MVVM design pattern for a clear separation of UI and business logic.
- Use cases to encapsulate business logic and ensure reusability across different layers.

## Modules

### App Module

The `app` module is the main Android application module responsible for UI interactions, dependency injection setup, and navigation. It interacts with domain-specific modules and showcases how presentation logic is handled using MVVM architecture.

### Domain Modules

#### Use Cases

The `usecase` module contains all the use cases (interactors) of the application. Each use case represents a specific business operation that can be executed from different parts of the application.

### Data Modules

#### Repository Pattern

The `repository` module implements the repository pattern, acting as an intermediary between data sources (local database, network services) and the domain layer. It handles data retrieval, caching, and synchronization.

### Presentation Modules

#### MVVM Architecture

The `presentation` module implements the MVVM architecture for managing UI-related logic. It includes ViewModels that interact with the domain layer through use cases and expose observable data streams to the UI.

## How do I get set up?

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio IDE
- Gradle Build System

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle and build the project.

### Configuration

- Configure API keys, endpoints, and other configurations in `local.properties` or through dependency injection mechanisms (e.g., Dagger Hilt).

### Dependencies

- Dependencies are managed via Gradle build files (`build.gradle`). Ensure all required dependencies are correctly resolved.

### Database Configuration

- The application uses Room Database for local data storage. Configuration and schema migrations are managed within the `repository` module.

### How to run tests

- Unit tests and instrumentation tests are located in respective modules (`usecase`, `presentation`). Use Android Studio's test runner or Gradle commands to execute tests.

### Deployment instructions

- Build signed APKs or bundle using Android Studio for deployment to devices or distribution platforms.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Follow the naming conventions and structure of existing tests.
- Ensure sufficient test coverage for critical business logic and edge cases.

### Code Review

- Pull requests should adhere to the project's coding style and architectural guidelines.
- Reviewers should focus on code quality, performance optimizations, and adherence to architectural principles.

### Other Guidelines

- Document new features, architectural decisions, and significant changes in the repository's `docs` folder or inline comments.
- Use Git branches for feature development and follow a Git flow workflow for branching and merging.
